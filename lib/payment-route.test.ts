// Integration tests for the /api/payment chokepoint, exercised through the REAL route, served
// by a real Next server:
//
//   node --test --test-timeout=180000 lib/payment-route.test.ts
//
// lib/bookability.test.ts covers the pure arithmetic. These cover what that arithmetic cannot:
// that the payment route actually CALLS the check, with the right arguments, and returns before
// reaching Square. A refactor that dropped the call, passed the wrong site, or moved the check
// below the charge would leave every pure unit test green — so the unit tests alone cannot
// protect the money. These can, because they drive the route end to end.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the first real-card test of this feature was reported as a double-
// booking that got charged. It turned out not to be one — the booking landed on a genuinely
// free site — but nothing in the suite could have told us that, and answering it took a
// database forensic. A route-level test that can be run in seconds is the thing that was
// missing.
//
// SAFETY. The server is started with SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN deliberately invalid, so no request
// this file makes can charge a card even if every gate failed at once. That also gives a clean
// discriminator, since the route's own response tells us which side of Square it stopped on:
//
//   - gated  -> our JSON with a `reason` field; Square was never contacted
//   - charged -> Square's "This request could not be authorized."; the gate let it through
//
// A rejected booking returns before the database insert, and an accepted one dies at the
// invalid Square call, which is also before the insert. So nothing is ever written.
//
// Needs a CONFIGURED Supabase project in .env.local, and data to exercise: a park with no
// bookings has no double-booking to refuse. Both are treated as skips rather than failures, so
// an unconfigured template checkout reports "skipped", never a false red.
